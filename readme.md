# create-react-hook

> CLI for creating reusable React hooks using Rollup and create-react-app.

[How and why I made this tool.](https://medium.com/@Hermanhasawish/how-to-create-a-reusable-react-hook-9e42e73b2f9a)

## Features

- Easy-to-use CLI
- Handles all modern JS features
- Bundles `cjs` and `es` module formats
- [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) for example usage and local dev
- [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) for bundling
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for transpiling
- [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) for testing
- Supports complicated peer-dependencies
- Optional support for TypeScript
- Sourcemap creation

## Install

This package requires `node >= 4`, but we recommend `node >= 8`.

```bash
npm install -g create-react-hook
```


## Creating a New Hook

```bash
create-react-hook
```

Answer some basic prompts about your module, and then the CLI will perform the following steps:

- copy over the template
- install dependencies via yarn or npm
- link packages together for local development
- initialize local git repo

## Development

Local development is broken into two parts (ideally using two tabs).

First, run rollup to watch your `src/` module and automatically recompile it into `dist/` whenever you make changes.

```bash
npm start # runs rollup with watch flag
```

The second part will be running the `example/` create-react-app that's linked to the local version of your module.

```bash
# (in another tab)
cd example
npm start # runs create-react-app dev server
```

Now, anytime you make a change to your library in `src/` or to the example app's `example/src`, `create-react-app` will live-reload your local dev server so you can iterate on your component in real-time.


#### Publishing to NPM

```bash
npm publish
```

This builds `cjs` and `es` versions of your module to `dist/` and then publishes your module to `npm`.

Make sure that any npm modules you want as peer dependencies are properly marked as `peerDependencies` in `package.json`. The rollup config will automatically recognize them as peers and not try to bundle them in your module.

#### Deploying to Github Pages

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This creates a production build of the example `create-react-app` that showcases your library and then runs `gh-pages` to deploy the resulting bundle.
